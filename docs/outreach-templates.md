# Outreach Templates - Phase 3

## Segment 1: UK Service Businesses (SMBs)
**Target:** Businesses similar to Talent Group (recruitment, consultancy, professional services).
**Goal:** Pitch custom automation to reduce ops time.

**Subject:** reducing your admin time by 70%

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is handling a lot of [specific process, e.g., candidate profiles / client bookings] manually.

I’m a software engineer who builds custom systems for UK service businesses. I recently helped a talent agency reduce their operations time by 70% by replacing their PDF decks with a live, automated platform.

I’m not an agency—I’m a solo builder looking for one or two select partners to build for this month.

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if we can automate your [specific painful process]?

Best,
Ayoola

## Segment 2: Design & Brand Agencies
**Target:** Agencies that do great design but need robust technical execution.
**Goal:** Pitch "Systems" partnership (white-label or referral).

**Subject:** dev partner for [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I’ve been following [Company Name]’s work on [Client/Project Name]—love the [specific detail about design].

I’m a full-stack engineer specializing in building high-performance web systems (Next.js/Node). I recently launched a custom platform that went from zero to 200+ monthly users in just 4 weeks.

I know agencies often struggle to find reliable technical partners who can deliver complex functionality without compromising the design vision.

Are you looking for a technical partner for any upcoming builds? I’d love to show you some of my recent "Systems" work.

Best,
Ayoola

## Segment 3: AI-Adjacent Founders
**Target:** Founders building in the AI space or needing AI features.
**Goal:** Pitch AI integration expertise.

**Subject:** AI integration for [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I saw you’re building [Product Name]—the approach to [specific feature] is really smart.

I’m an engineer building AI-enhanced web systems. I’ve been shipping tools that integrate AI for real business outcomes (not just hype), helping companies automate complex workflows.

I have some capacity this month to help ship a feature or MVP.

If you’re looking for someone who can move fast (I ship full platforms in ~4 weeks), I’d love to chat.

Best,
Ayoola
