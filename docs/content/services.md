## How We Work (Process)

1.  **Discovery (Day 0):** A 30-min call to understand your bottleneck. No tech jargon, just business problems.
2.  **Proposal (Day 2):** I send a fixed-price quote with clear deliverables and a timeline. No hourly billing surprises.
3.  **Build (Weeks 1-3):** Weekly check-ins. You get a live link to see progress from Day 7.
4.  **Launch & Handoff:** I deploy the system, record training videos, and hand over all source code. You own everything.
